        Responsible for the establishment of effective web
        infrastructure, development best practices, and knowledge
        transfer through research, collaboration, mentoring, and
        training.  Introduced and encouraged the use of collaborative
        tools such as Wiki, Maven, Perforce and Anthill.

      <projects>

	<project>
	  Led the design and development of middleware to facilitate
	  the exchange of data with 3rd-party web sites.  The service
	  provided a very simple Java API enabling access to vendor or
	  customer databases exposed via any text-based HTTP
	  interface, including SOAP, XML-RPC, and HTML. Encapsulating
	  the transformations of the clients' requests and subsequent
	  responses using XSLT stylesheets, the project utilizes many
	  best-of-breed open source tools including HttpClient, JTidy,
	  and dom4j.
	</project>

	<project>
          Developed a robust application of common Linux tools (ssh,
          rsync, at) to automate scheduled software distribution,
          configuration changes and production deployments to various
          secure networks of Linux machines.
	</project>
        
        <project>
          Implemented a DMZ-style web architecture for hosting
          customer voice applications.  Used clustered Apache nodes as
          SSL accelerators and reverse proxies to a JBoss/Jetty app
          server cluster, providing secure, efficient access to
          various resources, including VoiceGenie VoiceXML gateways
          and MySQL databases.  Proved the performance using the
          Grinder load-testing framework.
        </project>
        
	<project>
          Championed the conversion of internal source code control
          system from Starteam to Perforce after extensive evaluation
          of multiple SCM products.  Led the effort to port the
          existing codebase and established administrative policies
          and procedures resulting in a more streamlined project
          lifecycle and minimal dependence on sys-admin personnel.

        Co-led a team responsible for the reengineering of
        existing mainframe processes into a more automated and
        distributed web-based framework to support the delivery of
        customized credit marketing data.  Initial prototype allowing
        web clients to retrieve counts of people matching various
        demographic criteria was developed using Struts, Tiles and
        JBoss.  The prototype was deployed against a one percent
        sample of 288 million credit records in an Oracle 9i database.

	<project>
	  Developed the business objects to support
	  multiple J2EE Struts-based applications deployed using the
	  Struts JSP application framework, including a means for
	  locating the service providers closest to a particular
	  geocoded location, and a tool for selecting roadside
	  incident data matching various criteria stored within a
	  legacy AS/400 DB2 database.

	    Transparently mapped business objects to tables in an
