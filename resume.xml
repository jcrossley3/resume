          Bizzlr.com -- A Ruby on Rails "local search" application
          deployed not only standalone but on Facebook, MySpace, and

          between the OpenSocial and Facebook API's so that a single
          deployment served all four platforms.

          developed the remote API, allowing interaction with the site
          via both email and SMS (OpenMarket).  Built using Python and

        Helped design and develop Tandberg's OpenStream Switched
        Digital Video solution, focusing on two areas: 1) introducing
        Maven/Continuum to simplify the automated build/release
        process, and 2) refactoring the EJB3 entity relationships and
        the transactional services that acted on them to minimize data
        access and increase performance.  Using JBoss 4.0.5, Oracle
        10, JDK 1.5 and Linux RHEL4.

        Responsible for the establishment of effective web
        infrastructure, development best practices, and knowledge
        transfer through research, collaboration, mentoring, and
        training.  Introduced and encouraged the use of collaborative
        tools such as Wiki, Maven, Perforce and Anthill.  Development
        included both application and system software, with an
        emphasis on the latter.
      </description>
      <projects>

        <project>
          Developed an automated testing framework for speech-enabled
          VoiceXML applications, capable of both functional and stress
          testing.  The service would compile scripts written in a
          simple DSL into VoiceXML, place the outbound calls on a
          clustered VoiceGenie gateway and tabulate the results.  It
          included a web proxy component that would dynamically
          "decorate" audio files with specific DTMF tones when
          requested by the application under test, enabling the
          testing application to "hear" expected prompts in response
          to specific inputs, e.g. DTMF, TTS, or audio.  The entire
          application was written in Ruby.
        </project>

        <project>
          Led the design and development of middleware to facilitate
          the exchange of data with 3rd-party web sites.  The
          multithreaded, high-throughput service provided a simple
          Java API implemented as an EJB Stateless Session Bean
          enabling access to 3rd-party databases exposed via any
          text-based HTTP interface, e.g. SOAP, XML-RPC, or plain
          HTML. Encapsulating the transformations of the clients'
          requests and responses using XSLT stylesheets, the project
          used many best-of-breed open source tools including
          HttpClient, JTidy, and dom4j.
        </project>

        <project>
          Developed a robust application of common Linux utilities
          (ssh, rsync, at) to automate scheduled software
          distribution, configuration changes and production
          deployments to various secure networks of Linux servers.
        </project>

        <project>
          Designed and developed an application enabling customers to
          test their VoiceXML applications hosted on their remote web
          servers, providing secure access to the system logs
          generated by the VoiceGenie platform within our internal
          network, requiring sophisticated parsing of the log files to
          only reveal data relevant to each customer's specific
          application.  This was developed using the Spring, Struts,
          and Hibernate frameworks.
        </project>
        
        <project>
          Developed project templates based on Maven and Struts that
          enabled the quick construction of J2EE VoiceXML applications
          stubbed out enough to be immediately deployable and
          reasonably functional.  This resulted in a uniform source
          code structure consistent across all CPT projects for Struts
          actions, static content, project documentation, and unit
          tests.
        </project>

        <project>
          Instituted a policy of "idempotent system administration" in
          which system configuration was maintained under revision
          control, and installation shell scripts were written
          according to a convention such that any compatible Linux
          server could be configured with a specific "release" of
          system software.  This greatly simplified the management of
          the applications' system dependencies.
        </project>

        <project>
          Implemented a DMZ-style web architecture for hosting
          customer voice applications.  Used clustered Apache nodes as
          SSL accelerators and reverse proxies to a JBoss/Jetty app
          server cluster, providing secure, efficient access to
          various resources, including VoiceGenie VoiceXML gateways
          and MySQL databases.  Proved the performance using the
          Grinder load-testing framework.
        </project>
        
        <project>
          Championed the conversion of internal source code control
          system from Starteam to Perforce after extensive evaluation
          of multiple SCM products.  Led the effort to port the
          existing codebase and established administrative policies
          and procedures resulting in a more streamlined project
          lifecycle and minimal dependence on sys-admin personnel.

          Initial prototype allowing web clients to retrieve counts of
          people matching various demographic criteria was developed
          using Struts, Tiles and JBoss.  The prototype was deployed
          against a one percent sample of 288 million credit records
          in an Oracle 9i database.
        </project>
        <project>

          storage using EJB 2.1 CMP Entity beans deployed on JBoss.
