        <project>
          Bizzlr.com -- A Ruby on Rails "local search" application
          deployed on the Facebook, MySpace, and Hi5 platforms, as
          well as standalone.  The app was designed to encapsulate the
          differences between the OpenSocial and Facebook API's so
          that a single deployment served all four platforms.
        </project>

          business reviews, resource sharing, and more.  Also
          developed the remote API, allowing interaction with the site
          via both email and SMS (OpenMarket).  Built using Python and
          Django.

        the transactional services that acted on them to minimize data
        access and increase performance.  Using JBoss 4.0.5, Oracle
        10, JDK 1.5 and Linux RHEL4.

        Responsible for the establishment of effective web
        infrastructure, development best practices, and knowledge
        transfer through research, collaboration, mentoring, and
        training.  Development included both application and system
        software, with an emphasis on the latter.
      </description>
      <projects>

        <project>
          Developed an automated testing framework for speech-enabled
          VoiceXML applications, capable of both functional and stress
          testing.  The service would compile scripts written in a
          simple DSL into VoiceXML, place the outbound calls on a
          clustered VoiceGenie gateway and tabulate the results.  It
          included a web proxy component that would dynamically
          "decorate" audio files with specific DTMF tones when
          requested by the application under test, enabling the
          testing application to "hear" expected prompts in response
          to specific inputs, e.g. DTMF, TTS, or audio.  The entire
          application was written in Ruby.
        </project>

        <project>
          Led the design and development of middleware to facilitate
          the exchange of data with 3rd-party web sites.  The
          multithreaded, high-throughput service provided a simple
          Java API implemented as an EJB Stateless Session Bean
          enabling access to 3rd-party databases exposed via any
          text-based HTTP interface, e.g. SOAP, XML-RPC, or plain
          HTML. Encapsulating the transformations of the clients'
          requests and responses using XSLT stylesheets, the project
          used many best-of-breed open source tools including
          HttpClient, JTidy, and dom4j.
        </project>

        <project>
          Developed a robust application of common Linux utilities
          (ssh, rsync, at) to automate scheduled software
          distribution, configuration changes and staged, reversible
          production deployments to various secure networks of Linux
          servers.
        </project>

        <project>
          Enabled customers to test their VoiceXML applications hosted
          on their own web servers, providing secure access to the
          system logs generated by the VoiceGenie platform within our
          internal network, requiring sophisticated parsing of the log
          files to only reveal data relevant to each customer's
          specific application.
        </project>
        
        <project>
          Developed project templates based on Maven and Struts that
          enabled the quick construction of J2EE VoiceXML applications
          stubbed out enough to be immediately deployable and
          reasonably functional, resulting in a uniform source code
          structure across all CPT projects for Struts actions, static
          content, project documentation, and unit tests.
        </project>

        <project>
          Instituted a policy of "idempotent system administration" in
          which system configuration was maintained under revision
          control, and installation shell scripts were written
          according to a convention such that any compatible Linux
          server could be configured with a specific "release" of
          system software.  This greatly simplified the management of
          the applications' system dependencies.
        </project>

        <project>
          Implemented a DMZ-style web architecture for hosting
          customer voice applications.  Used clustered Apache nodes as
          SSL accelerators and reverse proxies to JBoss/Jetty app
          server clusters, providing secure, efficient access to
          various resources, including VoiceGenie VoiceXML gateways
          and MySQL databases.
        </project>
        
        <project>
          Championed the conversion of revision control system from
          Starteam to Perforce after extensive evaluation of multiple
          SCM products.  Led the effort to port the existing codebase
          and established administrative policies and procedures
          resulting in a more streamlined project lifecycle and
          minimal dependence on sys-admin personnel.

        Co-led a team responsible for the reengineering of existing
        mainframe processes into a more automated and distributed
        web-based framework to support the delivery of customized
        credit marketing data.  Initial Struts/JBoss prototype
        provided counts of people matching various demographic
        criteria against a one percent sample of 288 million credit
        records in an Oracle 9i database. User actions were captured
        by a "click stream" servlet filter spawning JMS events
        asynchronously persisted using EJB 2.1 CMP Entity beans.
