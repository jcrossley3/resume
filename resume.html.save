                  Responsibilities include the design, development and
                  deployment of large-scale, distributed systems, most to serve
                  the special needs of inbound call centers; the evaluation of
                  new technologies resulting in recommendations relevant to our
                  customers' requirements; the establishment of standards and
                  best practices for development teams; the mentoring of junior
                  staff 

                  <p><b>Projects:</b></p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
		      Developed the business objects to support
		      multiple J2EE Struts-based applications,
		      including a means for locating the service
		      providers closest to a particular geocoded
		      location, and a tool for selecting roadside
		      incident data matching various criteria stored
		      within a legacy AS/400 DB2 database (2/01-6/02)
		    </li>

                    <li>
		      Combined the Jetty embedded web server and the
		      JDOM document manipulation packages to form a
		      framework for defining applications in terms of
		      services that pass XML data back and forth via
		      HTTP (09/00-01/01)
		    </li>

                    <li>Developed an Accounts Payable interface between a
                    web-based application used for dispatching automotive
                    service providers and the J.D. Edwards' One World
                    accounting system (02/00-08/00)</li>

                    <li>Built a framework to simplify the implementation of the
                    Metadata pattern; to create, edit, and query for dynamic
                    attributes of business objects (04/00-06/00)</li>

                    <li>
                      Designed and developed a proprietary object-relational
                      persistence layer (08/99-09/00) 

                      <ul>
                        <li>Transparently mapped business objects to tables in
                        an Oracle RDBMS using the Java Reflection API to
                        encapsulate the dynamic construction and execution of
                        the SQL statements necessary to retrieve, save, and
                        delete those objects</li>

                        <li>Provided robust support for parent-child
                        relationships -- both aggregation and association --
                        including automatic cascading saves and deletes of
                        corresponding rows linked by direct foreign key or
                        intermediate association table</li>

                        <li>Combined Sun's Jini and Oracle's Advanced Queueing
                        libraries to form a distributed cache of replicated
                        business objects, synchronizing the JVM's using Jini
                        event notifications when the state of any cached object
                        changed</li>

                        <li>Featured built-in support for the automatic
                        management of concurrent access to the persistent
                        objects using an optimistic locking strategy</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Data Access Resource Manager (06/97-05/99) 

                      <ul>
                        <li>Co-designed a proprietary Interface Definition
                        Language (IDL) and C++ application framework which
                        simplified the development of peer-to-peer and
                        client-server components that created, sent and
                        received complex data structures comprised of STL
                        containers</li>

                        <li>Managed stateful, concurrent access to multiple
                        Oracle database instances, using Rogue Wave DBTools.h++
                        to invoke one or more SQL stored procedures within a
                        single transaction corresponding to a client's method
                        call</li>

                        <li>Efficiently spread load across distributed
                        processes, each with its own dynamically-configurable
                        pool of operating system threads and database
                        connections</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Created a user-friendly wizard with Visual Basic for
                    subscribing members to various roadside assistance and
                    monitoring programs; also enhanced NT-based resource
                    management components of a vehicle monitoring system using
                    Visual C++ (1/97-5/97) (01/97-05/97)</li>

                    <li>

                        <li>Adapted the chosen visual application development
                        tool, Revelation Technologies' OpenInsight, to the
                        MS-Windows printing API</li>

                        <li>Developed an API for generating simple dialog boxes
                        at runtime</li>

                        <li>Created a hierarchical "tree control" for the
